# Book-Recommender-System
Book recommendation system using a collaborative filtering method

A small deployed version of this app can be found [here](https://abhishek-jana-book-rcommender-system-app-yxqqzf.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- **Book search**: Users can search for specific books and view detailed information about them, including ratings and reviews.
- **Recommendation generation**: The system generates book recommendations for each user based on collaborative filtering.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone ttps://github.com/abhishek-jana/Book-Rcommender-System.git
```

2. Create a new environment using the following command:

```shell
conda create --name myenv
```
3. Activate the newly created environment:

``` shell
conda activate myenv
```
4. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
cd book-recommender-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Run the development server:
```shell
streamlit run app.py
```
7. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501/`


### APPROACH

The project utilizes the following workflows to generate book recommendations:

1. Book Search: Users can search for specific books and view detailed information, including ratings, reviews, and related books.
2. Recommendation Generation: The system generates book recommendations for each user based on the following method:
   - Collaborative filtering: Recommends books based on the preferences and ratings of similar users.

The system incorporates machine learning algorithms and data processing techniques to analyze user preferences and generate accurate recommendations.


## Results

The system's recommendation generation method, collaborative filtering, helps users discover books aligned with their interests. The user-friendly web interface allows users to search for books and explore detailed information, including ratings, reviews, and related books, enhancing their reading experience.

## Data Gathering
The book data for this project is gathered from the following sources:

- Goodreads API: An API that provides access to book data, including book titles, authors, genres, ratings, and reviews.

Deployment
The application is deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source framework for building interactive web applications. The deployment setup instructions can be found in the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app).

## Workflows
The following workflows are implemented in the movie recommendation system:

- **Book search**: Users can search for specific books and view detailed information about them, including ratings and reviews.
- **Recommendation generation**: The system generates book recommendations for each user based on collaborative filtering.


## Future Work
Some potential areas for future improvement and expansion of the movie recommendation system include:

- Implementing advanced recommendation algorithms, such as matrix factorization and deep learning-based models.
- Enhancing the user interface and user experience of the application.
- Incorporating additional data sources and features, such as user demographics and movie genres, to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- Creating an account or logging in to an existing account to personalize recommendations based on individual user preferences.
- Allowing users to rate movies they have watched to further improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- Providing personalized movie recommendations specific to existing users based on their viewing history and preferences.
- Implementing a feedback mechanism for users to provide feedback on recommended movies, helping to refine and enhance the recommendation process.
